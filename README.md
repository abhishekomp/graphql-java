# GraphQL Java Demo

This project demonstrates the GraphQL using Java Spring Boot application.



## Lessons Learned

- Uses graphql-spring-boot-starter version 14.0.0 using Java 11 and Spring Boot 2.7.18. Version 15.0.0 requires Java 17

- Uses maven-pmd-plugin for static analysis of code

- Enable GraphQL Playground (available at http://localhost:8080/playground) for interacting with GraphQL server by setting: graphql.playground.enabled=true
